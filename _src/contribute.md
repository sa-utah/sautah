## Why Contribute?

There are no dues or fees for SA membership. We are self-supporting through our own contributions. Contributing financially to the SA Utah Intergroup, also known as Sexaholics Anonymous Intergroup Utah (SAIUT), helps carry the message of hope, strength, and healing to others.

During in-person meetings, we pass a basket to collect voluntary cash contributions from participants. SAIUT uses funds received to pay rent on conference facilities for the annual fall Unity Retreat and for other purposes that support the Utah fellowship in seeking recovery. For those who prefer or need to contribute funds online, you can use any of the electronic payment options linked below.

### Transaction Fees Charged by Electronic Payment Providers

Please note that **PayPal deducts 1.99% + 0.49 USD** for domestic charity transactions. If you would like to contribute a specific amount (e.g., $5.00), there's an option to add an extra amount to your contribution to help cover the transaction fees. For example, to actually contribute $5.00 to the SA Utah Intergroup, add around $0.59.

**Venmo deducts 1.9% + 0.10 USD** for domestic charity transactions. You can simply add a bit more to your contribution if you want to help cover the fees.

**Zelle® charges us NO transaction fees.**
