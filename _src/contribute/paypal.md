You don't need a PayPal account to contribute using a credit or debit card. However, if you have a PayPal account, you can contribute using any of the cards or financial institutions associated with your account.

**PayPal deducts 1.99% + 0.49 USD** for domestic charity transactions. You can simply add a bit more to your contribution if you want to help cover the fees.
