We welcome all members to share their **experience, strength, and hope** around being a father, having a father, or healing from father wounds. This is a **safe and compassionate space**, where the complicated legacy of fatherhood—**absent, present, distant, or devoted**—can be honored with honesty and support.

You don’t need to bring a gift—just your story and your willingness to connect.
