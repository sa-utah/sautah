### Join us for the fourth annual SA 24-hour internet marathon with members from around the world sharing experience, strength and hope. Itâ€™s like an international convention on your phone or computer. Last year over 3,000 SA members participated! Learn from fellow members, laugh together, make new friends and celebrate what our Higher Power is doing in our lives!

### **This is a FREE event.**  
Once you're registered, you'll get an invite to the SIM 2021 WhatsApp group and, during the week of the event, the link to access SIM 2021.
